## About Me


I'm a statistician by trade who recently discovered the magical world of web development...

Over the next three months, I'll be a web development student at [Code Academy](http://codeacademy.org/).  My goal by the end of the program is to have made a fully-functional beer recommendation web application.

If you'd like to contact me about web development, beer, or other opportunities, don't hesitate to reach out!

Emily
