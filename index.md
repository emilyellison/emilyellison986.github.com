## About Me
<br/>
I'm a statistician by trade who recently discovered the magical world of web development...

Over the next three months, I'll be a web development student at [Code Academy](http://codeacademy.org/), and blogging about my experience along the way [here](http://emilyellison986.github.com/archive.html).  My goal by the end of the web development program is to have created a fully-functional beer recommendation web application.

If you'd like to contact me about web development, beer, or other opportunities, don't hesitate to reach out!
