So today, [Kori Roys](http://koriroys.com) told me that we were going to build a blog...

I was expecting this project to take several hours, involve Rails, and be generally exhausting.

We made a blog in under 20 minutes!

I am beginning to see that there are things at [GitHub](http://github.com) that might be incredibly useful for shortcuts, so you don't have to reinvent the wheel with every new project.

Can't wait to learn more!

Thanks [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com)!
